### What is this repository for? ###

Assessing the quality of experiments, both directly and through replication attempts, is becoming a grave concern in biomedicine. This is especially true in omics experiments, where thousands of independent measurements are done in parallel, with the understanding that only a small minority will probe scientifically meaningful effects â€“ a state of affairs conductive to mistaking false positives for scientific discoveries. A currently popular way to deal with false positives in omics is to calculate the Bayesian false-discovery rate (FDR) using, for the prior, the information present in the multitude of parallel measurements of a single omics experiment. To this picture we add a simple method to calculate a retrospective power that is compatible with the FDR. This allows to give a rich account of the quality and potential replicability of the results of almost any omics experiment. As proof of concept we assessed the quality of the 9202 high-throughput sequencing experiments from Entrez GEO database.
